    "# Building a Tucker Carlson bot using LangChain, Pinecone, Chat-GPT, and 813 Carlson transcripts\n",
    "## As simple as querying a database of Tucker Carlson's monologues from his Fox News show with Chat-GPT\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### First, a quick overview:\n",
    "Using LangChain, Pinecone, and Chat-GPT to query any documents you have is actually remarkably easy. The web scraping I did to just get the transcripts was the most complicated bit of coding in this process BY FAR. The monologue transcripts from Tucker Carlson Tonight were scraped from Fox News' website and cover a period from November 27, 2018 to March 16, 2023. I show the code below for how I scraped the transcripts using Selenium and Beautiful Soup. Feel free to skip over that section if you want to get straight to the nitty gritty of using LangChain and Pinecone to query the transcripts with Chat-GPT. \n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Scrape the transcripts (skip if you like).\n",
    "2. Create a single large document that contains all of the Carlson monologue transcripts that I scraped from the web.\n",
    "3. Use Langchain's recursive character splitter to break the document into chunks.\n",
    "4. Use OpenAIEmbeddings to turn each chunk of text into a vector.\n",
    "5. Store the vectors on Pinecone and allow for similarity search between them.\n",
    "6. Query the transcripts using Chat-GPT, providing the 20 most relevant chunks of text from the transcripts as context.\n",
    "7. Tweak your prompts for Chat-GPT (prompt engineering)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Web scraping 831 Tucker Carlson monologues from Fox News' website\n",
    "Edit: This code no longer works since Fox News has removed the following page that used to show all of Carlson's available monologues and transcripts: https://www.foxnews.com/category/shows/tucker-carlson-tonight/transcript\n",
    "\n",

    "The splitter simply slices the entire document we've created of all the transcripts into 1,000 character chunks of text (about 150 words per chunk). We can make the chunks as large or small as we like, but we want to make sure the chunks are large enough to provide relevant context, while at the same time not being so large that we lose precision. For example, if we ask Chat-GPT what Carlson's monologues say about California, we want the similarity search to pull in the most relevant examples of Carlson ranting about California and provide them as context to Chat-GPT. If the chunks are too small we may miss lots of relevant context, because Carlson may only mention California when he first starts speaking about it, and if the chunk ends before he finishes we will lose any additional context that's not included in that chunk.\n",

There was no attempted insurrection by white supremacist revolutionaries bent on taking over the country. Democrats are flat-out lying about what happened. The truth of that day is still unknown, but what we do know is that some in the crowd were encouraging protesters to breach the Capitol and commit felonies. We have pictures and video evidence of their faces and actions, but many are still not charged or on the FBI's Most Wanted list. Meanwhile, the government is using January 6th as an excuse to arrest, imprison, and crush anyone who leads opposition to Joe Biden's government, violating our First Amendment rights. The hypocrisy of the government and the media's reaction to January 6th is stunning, especially given their own history of inciting violent riots during the Trump administration. We must never forget the lies and tyranny that have resulted from January 6th.\n"

      "Taiwan is the world's biggest flashpoint and a ticking time bomb waiting to explode! For almost 80 years, the country has been itching to invade its neighboring country, Taiwan. It's the most delicate place diplomatically on the globe. If you're even sending a person to calm tensions or reassure allies, you're probably lying, and in fact, you may be provoking enemies and terrifying allies. The Chinese are just waiting for a pretext to invade Taiwan and take over the world's largest semiconductor foundry. The Biden administration is dangerously reckless for even considering a trip to Taiwan, and it's highly possible that the people running the government are doing it because they want to hasten the end of American hegemony. Taiwan is a flashpoint, and the world needs to pay attention before it's too late!\n"

      "America has been the most powerful country in the world for over a hundred years, shaping global assumptions about democracy, culture, and the value of human life. But this dominance is at risk, and it could end soon. The Chinese government is aggressive and ambitious, with a goal to knock the U.S. from its perch. And America is terrifyingly vulnerable, lacking critical medical supplies and relying on other countries for essential goods. Our ruling class has imported Chinese authoritarianism instead of exporting American freedoms, making China and our neoliberal elite richer while leaving ordinary Americans poor and less free. The U.S. government has encouraged companies to invest abroad, keep wages low, and ship jobs overseas, serving multinational companies instead of American workers. And yet, our leaders remain ignorant and careless, stuck in their own narrow frame of reference while China continues to subvert and dominate. America must wake up and embrace economic patriotism, prioritizing American jobs and workers over the interests of multinational companies and international capital.\n"

His aides keep putting him out there in public to talk, which is a joke because he can barely read a prepared statement. It's a zombie effort that lurches from one blunder to another.
